# Hey there, I’m huin2479!  

Between the syntax of code and the rhythm of words,  
I plant seeds of stories in the quiet spaces.

## 🌿 Who Am I?  

**A Coder's Soul:**  
🐠 Forever cultivating, yet the garden never fully grows.  
📚 A listener at heart, forever immersed in endless tales.  

**Where I Live:**  
🕰️ My thoughts: "More erratic than the ginkgo, outliving the night-blooming cereus."
